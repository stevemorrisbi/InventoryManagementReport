# Inventory Management Report 

The original data collect took items and ranked them from 1 - 10 ( 1 being of highest importance) for ordering priority. Data was also collected on the quantity that is needed for the particular items and as stated on the report, the Total Rank Score is a measure created using both previous rankings to calculate an overall score. It is this overall score which can now dictate the priority of inventory ordering, streamlining the descision process.
