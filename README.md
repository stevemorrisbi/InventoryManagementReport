# Inventory Management Report 

The original data collect took items and ranked them from 1 - 10 ( 1 being of highest importance) for ordering priority. Data was also collected on the quantity that is needed for the particular items and as stated on the report - the Total Rank Score is a measure created using both previous rankings to calculate an overall score. It is this overall score which can now dictate the priority of inventory ordering, streamlining the descision process.
